## üìñ Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables using a **star schema** to optimize for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## üöÄ Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using PostgreSQL to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources:** Importing data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:** Cleaning and resolving data quality issues before analysis.
- **Integration:** Combining both sources into a single, user-friendly data model.
- **Scope:** Focusing on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation:** Providing clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Developing SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior:** identifying trends and patterns.
- **Product Performance:** evaluating top-performing products.
- **Sales Trends:** analyzing revenue and growth trends.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture, which consists of three layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into PostgreSQL Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

---
## ‚úÖ Key Features
- **Data Ingestion:** Extracting data from CSV files into PostgreSQL.
- **Data Transformation:** Cleaning and standardizing the data.
- **Data Modeling:** Creating a Star Schema with fact and dimension tables.
- **SQL Analytics:** Writing optimized SQL queries to generate insights.
- **Data Architecture Visualization:** Using Draw.io for clear data flow diagrams.
